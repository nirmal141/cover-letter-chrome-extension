# Privacy Policy (Draft)

This extension generates cover letters by combining a job description with your resume text and sending them to your configured LLM API.

## What we store
- API base URL, model, API key, and optional resume text are stored locally in `chrome.storage.local` on your device.
- No analytics or tracking.

## What we send
- When you click Generate, the extension sends: job description text and your resume text to the LLM endpoint you configured (e.g., Perplexity/OpenAIâ€‘compatible endpoint). The request is made by the background service worker.

## What we do not do
- We do not transmit data to any server controlled by the publisher of this extension.
- We do not sell or share your data with third parties.

## Your control
- You can clear your stored API key and resume any time in the Options page.
